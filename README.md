====================

## Introduction

[BroadStreet](http://www.broadstreet.io) is a data and software company for social good. We believe that all people deserve access to the best information possible. BroadStreet builds our software for those working towards community change. We strive to ensure that data is accessible, affordable, and delightful to explore. BroadStreet has thousands of members all over the country. Members include students, non-profit leaders, and executives of multi-state and national organizations. We are proud of the range of our members.

BroadStreetâ€™s COVID-19 Data Project began as an in-house project by BroadStreet to collect county-level coronavirus case (#) and death (#) totals. As the pandemic spread across North America, 50 new Emergency Data Relief Interns were recruited to the team. This number doubled a week later as we grew to meet the expanding need for research-quality datasets. Now we have over 400 interns working in various data entry roles, in skills programs, and on special projects. The COVID-19 Data Project grew to become a non-profit, The BroadStreet Institute which began tThe Community Data Project. The Community Data Project  started as small action teams looking beyond COVID data and has expanded to become multiple tracks and teams focused on collecting data on important public health topics outside of the pandemic.

The Policy Track of the COVID-19 Data Project first created and piloted this concept to create a qualitative dataset about the contents of Community Health Needs Assessments (CHNAs). By comparing health needs, priorities, and other contents, the CHNAs can be systematically analyzed and geographically compared without regard to the specific health system or size. Since its inception, the CHNA Track has moved to the growing Community Data Project, where it has grown to include five data entry (DE) teams, a quality assurance (QA) team, and a data release (DR) team.

The data is structured and defined in the following way below:

<li>Service_Area_Type: Choose from the following options based on available info in CHNA</li>
<ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
<li>List of Counties: Service area defined by counties only in CHNA</li>
